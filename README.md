## 🔹 Overview
The system allows engineers to:
- Enter **Drilling RTDMM** and **Production SCADA** operational data
- Store records permanently in a **MySQL database**
- Generate an **Excel OPR report** dynamically from stored data

## 🔹 Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express  
- **Database:** MySQL

> Note: Backend services (API, database, Excel generation) run locally and are not hosted online due to platform limitations.

## 🔹 Remarks
This project focuses on **functionality, automation, and system design**, aligning with real-world industrial requirements rather than only UI aesthetics.
